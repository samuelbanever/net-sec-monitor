Network Security Monitor
A Python-based network security monitoring tool that captures and analyzes network traffic to detect potential security threats in real-time. This project was developed to demonstrate practical cybersecurity skills and understanding of network security concepts.
Project Overview
This tool monitors network traffic and provides real-time alerts for various security threats. It's designed to help network administrators and security professionals identify potential network-based attacks and suspicious activities.
Key Features

-Real-time packet capture and analysis
-Detection of common attack patterns:

Port scanning
SYN flood attacks
Suspicious connection attempts


ðŸ“Š Traffic visualization and reporting
âš¡ Alert system for immediate threat notification
ðŸ“ˆ Basic traffic statistics and analysis

Technologies Used

Python 3.8+
Scapy (for packet capture)
Pandas (for data analysis)
Matplotlib (for visualization)

Getting Started
Prerequisites
bashCopy- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Administrator/root privileges (required for packet capture)
